# Turtle Crossing Game

Play the Turtle Crossing game by running the python script `main.py` .

## Requirements

You will need to install the `turtle` module to run this game. Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install turtle.

```bash
pip install turtle
```

## Gameplay
1. Use the 'up' arrow key to move the turtle forward across the screen. Try to avoid hitting the moving cars.
2. After you reach the other side, the turtle will reset to the start position to start again, but this time the cars will be moving faster than before.

The highest score is recorded and will be always shown in-game.
