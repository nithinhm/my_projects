# Logistic Regression Classifier for Cats

This project contains code for a logistic regression classifier for distinguishing between images of cats and non-cats. The classifier uses a simple logistic regression model and is implemented using Python and NumPy.

## Getting Started

To get started with the code, you will need to have Python and NumPy installed on your machine along with some other libraries mentioned in the notebook.

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install these libraries. For example, to install NumPy:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

## Classify your own images
1. Open the `main.ipynb` notebook.
2. Run all code cells
3. Go to the last code cell and do as instructed.
